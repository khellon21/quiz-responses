## 1. In a subnet with a CIDR notation of /28, `14` host IP addresses are available

## 2. The Network topology provides the highest level of redundancy and fault tolerance, but is also the most expensive to implement is `Full Mesh`

3. The the primary function of a stateful firewall compared to a stateless packet filtering firewall is `It tracks the active state of connections and allows return traffic dynamically`

4. The subnet mask corresponds to a /24 CIDR prefix is `255.255.255.0`

5. In network security design, the purpose of a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is `To host public-facing services while isolating them from the internal LAN.  `

6. The OSI layer is primarily responsible for logical addressing and routing packets between different networks is `Layer 3 (Network)`

## 7. The result of applying the subnet mask 255.255.255.192 to a Class C network is `It creates 4 subnets with 62 usable hosts each.`

8. The rule is typically found at the end of a firewall Access Control List (ACL) to ensure security best practices is `Implicit Deny` 

## 9. The primary benefit of using VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) in network design is `To segment broadcast domains and improve security.`

## 10. The host has the IP address 192.168.1.65 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192,the Network ID is `192.168.1.64`

11. The protocol is used to prevent switching loops in a network design with redundant paths is `STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)`

12. The is the broadcast address for the subnet 172.16.10.0/26 is `172.16.10.63`

## 13. The type of firewall is capable of inspecting the actual payload of a packet (e.g., detecting malware or blocking specific websites) rather than just headers is `Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)`

14. In a Star topology, `the switch` typically serves as the central connection point.

15. NAT (Network Address Translation) commonly used in network design `To conserve public IPv4 addresses and hide internal IP schemes`
